    "\n",
    "- **Class Blueprint**: At the heart of our operations is the `Text2ImgModel` class. This acts as the central hub, choreographing the process of transforming textual prompts into visual masterpieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: When we instantiate this class, we have the liberty to tailor its behavior. This includes selecting the model's path, the device (defaulting to Intel's \"xpu\"), the data type, and more. There are also provisions to supercharge the model's performance via optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Onboarding**: The `_load_pipeline` function is where we bring the pre-trained model onboard. This sets the stage for all our text-to-image transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Performance is paramount. With the `_optimize_pipeline` and `optimize_pipeline` methods, we leverage Intel-specific optimizations using the Intel Extension For PyTorch (IPEX) to ensure our model runs like the wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Warming Up**: Just like a car on a cold morning, our model benefits from a brief warm-up. The `warmup_model` method handles this, ensuring that our model is primed and ready for the tasks ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Grand Finale - Image Generation**: The `generate_images` method is where dreams meet reality. It interprets the textual prompts, consults with the model, and then crafts images that encapsulate the essence of the prompts. You can specify the number of images, the number of noise removal steps, and even the save path for these artworks.\n",

    "The stable diffusion models provided here are powerful tools for high-resolution image synthesis, including text-to-image and image-to-image transformations. While they are designed to produce high-quality results, users should be aware of potential limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality Variation:** The quality of generated images may vary based on the complexity of the input text or image, and the alignment with the model's training data.\n",
    "- **Resource Consumption:** These models may require significant computational resources, and performance might vary depending on the hardware used.\n",
    "- **Licensing and Usage Constraints:** Please carefully review the licensing information associated with each model to ensure compliance with all terms and conditions.\n",
    "- **Ethical Considerations:** Consider the ethical implications of the generated content, especially in contexts that may involve sensitive or controversial subjects.\n",
